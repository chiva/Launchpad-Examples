Launchpad Examples
==================

Here you will find the [code examples](http://userweb.elec.gla.ac.uk/j/jdavies/mspbook/) from the book [MSP430 Microcontroller Basics](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/714092/description#description) written by [John H. Davies](http://userweb.elec.gla.ac.uk/j/jdavies/), modified to be runned on Texas Instruments' [Launchpad](http://ti.com/launchpadwiki).
Also, instead of using IAR Workbench, code has been ported to CCS (Code Composer Studio) which gives us four times more space to code in the free version.
